# resetcss
Yet another CSS reset stylesheet.

This is a reset stylesheet similar to
[Eric Meyer’s `reset.css`](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
It strips all elements of all browser-default styles so that everything looks
exactly the same. It is meant to be used *before*, and in conjunction with,
[Nicolas Gallagher’s `normalize.css`](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/),
as it leaves out some of those essential styles.
Rulesets are ordered by CSS property, not by selector.
